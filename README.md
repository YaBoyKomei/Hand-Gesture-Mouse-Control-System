# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control-System
## Hand Gesture Mouse Control using Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV

This project enables users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures detected through a webcam. Built with Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, it leverages real-time computer vision to recognize hand landmarks and map them to mouse movements and clicks — providing a touch-free, intuitive way to interact with your computer.

## Features

Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands

Control mouse movement and clicks through custom gestures

Supports actions like move, click, drag, and scroll

Lightweight and easy to set up with minimal dependencies

Works seamlessly on most webcams

## Technologies Used

Python

MediaPipe

OpenCV

PyAutoGUI (for mouse control)

## How It Works

Captures webcam input using OpenCV

Detects and tracks hand landmarks via MediaPipe

Maps specific hand gestures to mouse actions

Uses PyAutoGUI to control the system mouse in real time
